## 🤔 What is this project?
This project is a neural network implementation from scratch in C# with CUDA support written in C++. It currently supports Optical Digit Recognition (ODR) trained with 60,000 images and can also perform XOR as a simple initial test.

## ❗Info
At the current point I would not recommend this in any production environment, for me its just a fun little project to learn more about CUDA and Neural Networks.


## 🛠️ Features
- **Optical Digit Recognition (ODR)**: Trained with the MNIST dataset of 60,000 images.
- **XOR Test**: A simple test to demonstrate the neural network's basic functionality.
- **CUDA Support**: Accelerates neural network training using GPU resources.
